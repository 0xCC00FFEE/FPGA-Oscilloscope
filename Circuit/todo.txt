 x Capacitors for all chips: especially need 1uF + 0.1uF for VRAM
 - Analog frontend (variable gain)
 - Optimize pin-pin mappings to reduce crossing traces
 - Flash programmer
 x Smaller voltage regulator?
 x Add IC socket section + power and wire-wrap holes
 - Add voltage sense pins
 - Add holes for standoffs
 - Increase board size
 - USB? Probably not...
 - Leave adequate space for JTAG connector
 - Add latching power switch
 - 5V Regulated supply for VRAM
 - Check footprints for:
    - diodes
    - pushbutton switches
    - latching pushbutton switches
    - display (correct spacing apart from each other?)

 - Autorouter:
    - power trace 30 mil
    - signal trace 10 mil
    - via 30 mil outer x 15 mil inner
