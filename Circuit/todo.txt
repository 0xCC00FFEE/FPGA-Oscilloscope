 x Fix oscillator footprint
 x Ferrite bead separate Analog and Digital grounds
 - AGND w/ ground plane
 - Fix analog frontend (adopt new design)
 - Higher bandwidth digital pots?
 - Keep RF diodes for input from BNC; change to Schottky for input to ADC (lower Vf)
 - Add jumpers for analog frontend: AGND, ADCA, ADCA#, ADCB, ADCB#, REFOUT, +12, -12

 - Board labels (logic analyzer, vertical sensitivity, time sensitivity, vertical offset, trigger offset, trigger level)
