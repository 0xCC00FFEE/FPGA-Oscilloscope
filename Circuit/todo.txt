 x Capacitors for all chips: especially need 1uF + 0.1uF for VRAM
 - Analog frontend (variable gain)
 x Optimize pin-pin mappings to reduce crossing traces
 x Flash programmer
 x Smaller voltage regulator?
 x Add IC socket section + power and wire-wrap holes
 x Add voltage sense pins
 x Add holes for standoffs
 x Increase board size
 x USB? Probably not...
 x Leave adequate space for JTAG connector
 x Add latching power switch
 x 5V Regulated supply for VRAM
 - Check footprints for:
    - diodes
    - pushbutton switches
    - latching pushbutton switches
    - display (correct spacing apart from each other?)

 x Autorouter:
    x power trace 30 mil
    x signal trace 10 mil
    x via 30 mil outer x 15 mil inner
