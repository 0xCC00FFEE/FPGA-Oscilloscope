 - Fix oscillator footprint
 - Ferrite bead separate Analog and Digital grounds
 - Fix analog frontend (adopt new design)
 - Higher bandwidth digital pots?
 - Keep RF diodes for input from BNC; change to Schottky for input to ADC (lower Vf)
 - Add jumpers for analog frontend: AGND, ADCA, ADCA#, ADCB, ADCB#, REFOUT

 - Board labels (logic analyzer, vertical sensitivity, time sensitivity, vertical offset, trigger offset, trigger level)

 x Power LED
 x Add 9bit address line for VRAM
 x Add resistor to GND and VCC for S1 and S2 of ADC
 x 47uF from 5V rail
 x 1 ohm resistors to VREG need AXIAL0.7 footprint
 x Remove MSEL pulldown resistors
 x Add pullups for IO-driven buffer direction lines
 x Move reset from WDT chip to other pin
 x i2c int from touch display
